<h1>Libster Final Project Submission for CSCI 3110 (Adv. Web) @ ETSU w/ Dr. Jeffrey Roach</h1> 
<br /> 

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
Libster is a personal book cataloging web-application that utilizes the .NET MVC framework alongside JavaScript for dynamic features and AJAX for backend data processing. Bootstrap was utilized for site customization and modal creation. <br /><br />

Libster provides users (particularly the developer...) the ability to track their home library collections! Long-term, Libster will provide users with the ability to create a catalog of books and create custom "playlists" to group books by themes or by metrics of personal choosing! Be on the lookout for more developments in the future.
