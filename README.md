<h1>Libster Final Project Submission for CSCI 3110 (Adv. Web) @ ETSU w/ Dr. Jeffrey Roach</h1> 
<br /> 

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
Libster is a personal book cataloging web-application that utilizes the .NET MVC framework alongside JavaScript for dynamic features and AJAX for backend data processing. Bootstrap was utilized for site customization and modal creation. 

Libster provides users (particularly the developer...) the ability to track their person library collections! Long-term, Libster will provide users with the ability to create a catalog of books and create custom "playlists" to group books by themes or by metrics of personal choosing! Be on the lookout for more developments in the future.
